## About This Code

This code is the base of my honors research project titled "Examining the
Effects of Faculty Salary and Work Experience on Student Outcomes at Southern
4-Year Colleges and Universities." 

It contains all of the manipulation required during the model building process
that was not already done in Excel. Note that the data cleaning process was 
done almost entirely in Excel, but all model building and statistical analysis
was performed in R. 


## Inspiration Behind this Project

I wrote this code during the fall semester of my senior year at Presbyterian 
College. I was interested in conducting an independent research project to 
further develop my skills, but I wanted to explore a topic that interested me. 
Working with a professor I now think of as a mentor, I came up with this topic
which relates back to my interest in potentially pursuing a PhD. 


## Data Used

All data used for this project is publicly available, thus making it free and
"easy" to replicate. In addition to this, the cleaned data set that I used for 
the analysis has been linked on the GitHub for the project so that others may
use it to perform their own analysis or replication. 

The two main data source for this project were IPEDS and College Scorecard. Both
are maintained and annually updated by the United States government. More info
on both data sets can be found in the methodology section of the paper. 


## Aggregation

The data aggregation is explained in detail in the appendix of the paper. The 
most important aggregations to note are:

* All faculty and staff salary which is measured per student at the institution

* All faculty experience "ranks" are measured as a proportion of the faculty/staffs

is available but has been submitted to conferences and will soon be submitted
